Hahaha. Finally, I have finished my final graduation thesis! It was a long journey with a lot of stories from my 4 year journey at HUST. There are so many memories and emotions. I both feel free and feel empty by now.

Anyway, this is my handnote for some collected questions about control system, motor control I asked myself. Some of them are a bit silly, but they helped me have a deeper understand about certain problems. I think looking in the system and having self-questioning is a good way to improve the critical thinking skill, which are very important in both learning and working.

Table of contents:
 1. Ld is the direct inductance aligned with the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, while Lq is perpendicular to Ld. How can we detect the d and q vectors when a motor has more than one permanent magnet?
 2. What is the meaning of Ld and Lq?
 3. PMSM fundamental equations: Voltage equation, Torque equation
 4. Why and when do we want over modulation?
 5. The relationship between phase current frequency and the motor speed?
 6. Why do we want low THD (Total Harmonic Distortion)?
 7. Why is the six-step control method popular for BLDC motor?
 8. How do SVPWM + Hall sensor control method work?
 9. How does PLL work?
 10. Why do we have E_alpha, E_beta in eq.(1) of Question 9 ?
 11. Explain the components in Final Graduation board.
 12. What is the bootstrap circuit. Why is it important to our inverter? 
 13. Why do we use delta load instead of wye load in our motor control test?
 14. How can we use Hall sensors for FOC method?
 15. Explain why do we have those equations in Question 12?
